# Hi there 🐛

## Welcome to my profile!

I'm Armando Cifuentes González, well known as ArCiGo! 🕵️‍♂️ 🔎 🐞

I'm a **Software Engineer in Test**, **Science Popularizer** at [_Sólo es Ciencia_](https://soloesciencia.com/) and a **Math**/**Testing**/**Career & ISTQB CTFL mentor** 👨‍🏫.

I have been working performing manual (Web & mobile) and automation (Web) testing, using different kinds of tools, processes and methodologies. I'm always focused on the customer needs and the user experience of the products I test.

Sometimes I give talks about testing and professional growth ⬇️.
